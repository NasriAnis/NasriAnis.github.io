I developed an early interest in technology and computers, which naturally evolved into a fascination with how systems operate and how they can be secured. This curiosity led me to pursue cybersecurity, particularly from an offensive perspective, where I could understand not just how systems work, but how they fail.

I specialize in offensive security with a focus on reverse engineering and exploit development. My work involves analyzing systems at the instruction level to understand how hardware and software interact, which I believe is essential for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

I dedicate significant time to low-level system analysis, binary reverse engineering, and low-level programming. My approach involves understanding computer internals—from processor architecture and memory management to how the operating system interfaces with hardware—to build a comprehensive foundation for security research. I focus on deconstructing compiled code to understand its underlying logic and uncover potential security weaknesses.

My technical interests span assembly language, system programming, and the inner workings of operating systems. I study how computers execute instructions, manage resources, and handle data at the lowest levels, as this knowledge directly informs my ability to identify exploitable conditions. I'm also actively exploring mobile application reverse engineering, analyzing how mobile apps function and where security weaknesses may exist. While I'm continuously developing my skills in this field, I maintain a disciplined practice of daily research and hands-on experimentation.

My primary areas of focus include binary analysis, program reverse engineering, mobile application security, exploit development, low-level programming, and understanding system internals from an attacker's perspective. I use this platform to document my research, share technical insights, and collaborate with other security researchers.
