I have always been fascinated by the raw complexity of computers, their inner workings, and the challenge of securing them through an offensive lens. Operating from my Ubuntu host, I spend my time diving into low-level internals to understand the machine from the instruction level up, as I believe true mastery only comes from knowing how the hardware and software communicate at the most fundamental level. This curiosity drives me into the depths of reverse engineering and exploit development; and while I consider myself to be in a continuous learning stage, I am dedicated to mastering new concepts and practicing every single day to sharpen my technical intuition.

I have found a true passion for deconstructing binaries and analyzing decompiled code to uncover the hidden logic within it.

I hope this platform serves as a place to connect with like-minded researchers and exchange knowledge.
